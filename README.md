# NCAA 14 Dynasty Tool README

This dynasty tool is an all-in-one dynasty tool that will expand with each update. At launch, this tool includes two modules: Realistic Draft Declaration and Full Player Progression (All teams). Please read through this carefully so you can understand how to use it without asking questions already answered. There is also a HELP tab in the app that will be updated periodically with FAQs.

## Installation

To install the dynasty tool, simply extract the .exe file and double click it. You will want to install for ALL USERS for most cases and leave the default path to PROGRAM FILES. Changing any of this may result in user error on future updates. If you know what you are doing, feel free to install it wherever you would like.

## Usage

> Creating Your Dynasty Folder

The first thing you want to do is to create your dynasty folder. Click `CREATE NEW DYNASTY` and make the name something you will recognize the dynasty incase you have multiple. Select a FOLDER color of your choice (this is just for aesthetics). You will then be taken to the Dynasty Hub.

> The Dynasty Hub

The dynasty hub is the central location of all the modules that will be in the app. As mentioned, only two exist but this will change in future updates. You can also view your history that each module will save, more on this later. To access an action, click the box that you want to run and  you will open your dynasty file. If you get an error, pay attention to what it says.

> NFL Draft Declaration

This module simply revamps the system used to determine the draft projection order and if underclassmen will declare. The base game has issues with bringing back too many underclassmen that would realistically declare for the draft if projected high enough. This module gives each player a draft value and if any underclassmen are projected to be drafted, they have a weighted roll to decide if they go or stay. Maybe a 94 OVR QB is projected to go in the 3rd round but decides to come back to shoot for that #1 overall spot! Transfers are BASE GAME transfers, there is no transfer system yet implemented into this tool.

> Player Progression

This is the module most will be excited for, it provides a complete 126 team, 6500+ player progression system. The system takes the player's hidden potential and their discipline combined with their school's grades (Academics, Facilities, Pro Potential, and Prestige) and coach ratings (Head Coach and their coordinator). Each player is ranked into respective tiers based on their generated development rating. Tiers have weighted odds for a progression/regression system that goes -7 to +12. Being tier 1 does not guarantee top progression and could plateau before ever hitting their full potential. You can sort all columns that allow you to click on them, to sort by PROGRESSION/REGRESSION, you have to sort the PLAYER column for now. Viewing the whole NCAA has a search bar to quickly search key players you have been watching, it has a lazy load so be sure to hit enter when done typing your search item. You can click a player's name to view his profile, more on that below.

> Player Profiles

Each player will have his own player profile. This will include a few details of his personal info, but most importantly, display his attributes and their changes. There is a progression history tab to view a player's progression history throughout his career. You can even view players who are no longer in school as you progress further in your dynasty. Awards/Honors will be added in a later update once a few kinks are worked out.

> Viewing History

One of the coolest features is viewing your ENTIRE dynasty history of drafts and progression (plus any other modules that get added). If you want to go back last year to see who was projected to be the #1 pick, you can. Maybe you were watching a QB attempt to improve his draft grade only to regress and drop to an undrafted QB, there are many possibilities. To view history, you must have ran that module at least one time. It will create a folder with that dynasty year with the correct information. You can sort and filter the same on history as you do the normal modules.

## Future Updates
> Updating the Application

To update your application, all you need to do is download the newest version from inside the app and extract the .exe from the downloaded zip file. Double click the .exe and make sure your selected option says `REINSTALL/UPGRADE`. Follow the prompts and make sure the install path is the same exact path as you previously installed it.

> New Features

No need to ask if we are we adding A... B... C... As time allows, more features will be looked at and coded when able. There are plans already for additional modules, be patient.
